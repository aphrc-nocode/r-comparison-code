## AUTOML Training Repo

The pipeline integrates gemini API via [gemini.R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gemini.R/index.html) into the auto-ml pipeline. The integration allows for automated interpretation of key outputs.

### Requirements

#### R and RStudio

Download and install R.

- [Windows](https://cran.case.edu/bin/windows/base/)
	- For Windows users, download [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
- [Mac](https://cran.case.edu/bin/macosx/)
- [Linux](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-r-on-ubuntu-20-04/)

Next step is to download Rstudio and install

- [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

#### R packages

- Run `R code`:

```
source("requirements.R")
```


#### Gemini API

- Get [Gemini API](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- Copy and paste the API key into the R function below


#### Download Rautoml package

- Either via [pkgs](./pkgs) or `requirements.R`

```
Rautoml::set_api("GEMINE_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY")
```


###  Usage

- Use your own data or dowmload sample data from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CYGUBICKO/automl-training/refs/heads/main/data/heart_data.csv).
- Open `simple_ml_pipeline.R` from your preferred editor (Rstudio recommended) and run line by line for default usage. Once you familiarize with the codebase, you can change the data via `data_path`, etc.
- Edit [upload_data.R](upload_data.R) to specify data
- Edit [model_config.R](model_config.R) to change default parameters outline above.
- Edit the [data_management.R](data_management.R) file to add any data transformations needed.
	- `data_management` - `TRUE/FALSE`. Set to `FALSE` for default.

#### Key components

- You can modify the following variables depending on the task:
	- `experiment_name` - This gives a tag to the current experiment. The output folder which contains all the files related to the current experiment will be tagged this, i.e., `outputs_your_experiment_name`.
	- `study_description` - The description of the study or current dataset. You can also include study objective.
	- `data_path` - URL or path to the dataset. Supports .csv, .xlsx, .xls, .dta, .rda, .rds, .spss files.
	- `problem_type` - Whether "classification" or "regression" problem
	- `outcome_var` - The outcome of interest. The variable should be in the dataset
	- `train_test_ratio` - Training-test data ratio for partitioning
	- `corr_threshold` - Correlation threshold, ranges `[0, 1]`, for bivariate comparison of variables. One of the highly correlated variables is dropped based on the threshold
	- `handle_missing` - How to hand missing values. It can either be "omit", "missing_mean", "missing_median", "mode_median", "mode _mean", "bag", "knn", or "knn_linear"
	- `cv_method` - Cross-validation method. It can be "CV ", "repeatedcv ", "adaptive_cv", "LOOCV ", "LGOCV ", "adaptive_LGOCV ", "boot", "boot632", "optimism_boot", "boot_all", or "adaptive_boot"
	- `n_folds` - Number of cross-validation folds. Either 3, 5, or 10.
	- `cv_repeats` - Number of repeats in cross-validation
	- `performance_metric` - Measure of model performance
		- For regression: "RMSE", "Rsquared", "MAE"
		- For classification: "AUCROC", "Accuracy", "AUCRecall", "Sens", "Spec", "Precision", "Recall", "F"
	- `report_metric` - Depending on the task, it can be any of the above
